# Loot Sheet NPC PF2e

This module adds an additional NPC sheet which can be used for loot containers such as chests or merchants. It also allows spells to be automatically converted into spell scrolls by dragging them onto this sheet. 

##### Permissions
Permissions can be set in the sheet for each player and range from no access (cannot open sheet) to observer (view sheet and contents) to owner (view sheet and add/remove items).

##### Shopkeeper Sheet
Can be used to create an inventory of a shopkeeper to allow players to peruse their inventory. Prices are listed next to each item.
